const Version = "0.3.0"

// go-atum requires a version of bolthold newer than the latest release v1.1, but go-atum does not
// use dep, so by default dep fetches v1.1 which breaks the build. We make bolthold an explicit
// dependency here, so that we can require its version to be sufficiently new in a [[constraint]] in
// Gopkg.toml: an [[override]] would not propagate to the users of irmago. This is ok, as we will
// have bolthold as actual dependency soon anyway. go-atum uses go mod files which does properly
// lock its bolthold dependency, so:
// TODO: remove this line after we switch to go modules
